Hi! I'm a programmer passionate about low-level programming, compilers and the open-source world.  
I love exploring decentralized, self-hosted technologies and understanding how things work under the hood.

Beyond code, I'm deeply interested in libertarian ethics, epistemology and the philosophy of mind.  
I'm always curious to understand how things work, whether in machines or in ideas and how technology can empower individual freedom.

I'm currently working with MES, performing both corrective and evolutionary maintenance and ensuring smooth integration with ERP systems, primarily using:

- **C#, .NET (Core & Framework), ASP.NET and VB 6.0**

- **NHibernate, Entity Framework and ADO.NET**

- **SQL Server and Oracle database**

- **Azure DevOps (CI/CD), SSIS, DTS and SQL-based data integration**
